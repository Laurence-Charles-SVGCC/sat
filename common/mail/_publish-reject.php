                        <p>Your application for entry to the St. Vincent and the Community College for the 2015-2016 academic year has been reviewed.  
                            It is with regret that I write to inform you that you did not meet the College's entry requirements and we are unable to offer 
                            you a place in one of the College's full-time Programmes this year.
                            We do however, encourage you to seek to improve your current results and re-apply for admission in the next academic year.
                            </p>
                        <p>We appreciate the interest that you have shown in the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Community College.
                        Please accept our best wishes in your future endeavours and as you continue your education.</p>
                        
                        <p>With warm wishes and kind regards,</p>
