                        <p>Your application for entry to the St. Vincent and the Community College for the 2014-2015 academic year has been reviewed.  
                            It is with regret that I write to inform you that you either did not meet the College's entry requirements and we are unable to offer 
                            you a place in one of the College's full-time Programmes this year.  
                            We can however give you provisional acceptance into the Pre College Programme. If you are interested in accepting this offer please respond the above address by Tuesday 26 August, 2014 at 4:00 p.m.</p>
                        <p>We appreciate the interest that you have shown in the St. Vincent and the Grenadines Community College.</p>
                        <p>With warm wishes and kind regards,</p>
